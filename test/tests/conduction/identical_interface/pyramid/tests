                  "Because only a constant heat flux is passed for each element during the data transfer "
                  "from MOOSE to nekRS, we do not expect the results to match perfectly with the MOOSE "
                  "standalone case (which represents the heat flux internally as a continuous function "
                  "(as opposed to elementwise-constant). We compare extrema temperature values on the "
                  "two pyramid blocks with the MOOSE solution, and see that (1) the overall temperature "
                  "distribution matches qualitatively, and (2) the difference between the Cardinal case "
                  "and the MOOSE standalone case decreases as the mesh is refined (i.e. as the effect of "
                  "the constant monomial surface heat flux is lowered). Even with the fairly coarse mesh "
                  "used in this test, the errors in temperature are less than 1% of the total temperature "
