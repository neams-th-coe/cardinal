                  "A reference MOOSE standalone problem (in moose.i) solves the equation "
                  "k*nabla(T)=7*T, i.e. the 'heat source' is 7*T. This surrogate problem is then "
                  "replicated with Cardinal, where nekRS solves the k*nabla(T)=q, where q is a "

                  "nekRS. This problem does not really represent any interesting physical case, but "
                  "is solely intended to show that nekRS correctly solves the heat equation with a "
                  "heat source 'computed' by some other app. The solution matches the standalone MOOSE "

                  "MOOSE standalone case to within 0.1%. To keep the gold files small here, this test "
                  "is only performed on a 10x10x10 nekRS mesh."
