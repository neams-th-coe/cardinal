# This problem solves a dummy heat conduction problem - f is an auxvariable that
# is simply set to the value of x, and average_f is the average of f in each pebble,
# with those values associated with points in space (which we set to the pebble centroids).
# We want to check that the sub-app receives the correct value in each pebble.

# Likewise, in the sub-app, g is just an auxvariable that is set to x*x, and average_g is
# the average in each pebble, with those values associated with points in space (which
# we set to the pebble centroids). We want to check that the master app receives the
# correct value in each pebble.
