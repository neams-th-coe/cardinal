/**
 * Here, we set all of the various boundary conditions. These are "device" functions
 * because all of the solution occurs on the device (including the application of
 * boundary conditions). nekRS gives you ultimate flexibility in how to set boundary
 * conditions - here, we apply the conditions based on the sideset ID and, for the scalars,
 * the scalar ID. In some places we use kernel variables defined in the `.udf` file.
 *
 * Each of the functions here is only called on the boundaries that use that condition,
 * according to what is set in the boundaryTypeMap in the .par file. However, we want
 * to be sure that this file matches what the .par file suggests, so we perform some
 * extra checks on validity here.
