# CellTally

!alert note
`CellTally` can only be added to problems when the input files contains a [OpenMCCellAverageProblem](OpenMCCellAverageProblem.md)
in the `[Problem]` block. Otherwise, attempting to add this tally will result in an error.

## Description

The `CellTally` class wraps an OpenMC tally with a distributed cell filter to enable data transfer
from CSG cells to a [MooseMesh](MooseMesh.md) mirror
of the OpenMC geometry. The cell to element mapping established by the [OpenMCCellAverageProblem](OpenMCCellAverageProblem.md)
is used to facilitate this data transfer to the mesh mirror. When using a `CellTally`, `tally_blocks`
specifies which blocks in the `[Mesh]` should be tallied. Then, any OpenMC cells that map to those
blocks are added to a cell tally, with one bin for each unique cell ID/instance combination.
`check_equal_mapped_tally_volumes` is used to confirm whether each cell in the `CellTally` has the
same mapped volume on the `MooseMesh` (to a tolerance specified in `equal_tally_volume_abs_tol`).

## Example Input File Syntax

As an example, this `CellTally` scores `kappa_fission` (the default tally score) on block `0` and stores
the result in a variable named `heat_source`. This corresponds to tallying the heating for three different
fuel pebbles.
