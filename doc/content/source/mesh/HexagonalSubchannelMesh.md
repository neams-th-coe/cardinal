# HexagonalSubchannelMesh

!syntax description /Mesh/HexagonalSubchannelMesh

## Description

This class builds a 3-D mesh of a
triangular lattice of pins enclosed in a hexagonal duct with a uniform axial
discretization. The `theta_res` parameter indicates how many nodes should be
placed on the pin's surface in each channel, while the `gap_res` parameter
indicates how many nodes should be placed on each gap.

To allow easy averages or other postprocessors to be applied by channel type,
all interior, edge, and corner channels are by default set to a unique subdomain ID
(1 for the interior channels, 2 for the edge channels, and 3 for the corner channels).
This behavior can be controlled by setting the `interior_id`, `edge_id`, and
`corner_id` parameters to the desired subdomain IDs.

By default, this class will create a volume mesh of a subchannel discretization
(i.e. using 3-D elements). By setting `volume_mesh = false`, you can instead create
2-D plane meshes (on planes perpendicular to `axis`), such as for visualizing results
from a user object paired with a [LayeredGapBin](LayeredGapBin.md).

!alert warning
This class is intended *ONLY* for visualization purposes - node connectivity between
elements is not obeyed, so you cannot use this mesh to solve any anything that requires
connectivity information between elements (such as a finite element solve).

## Example Input syntax

The following shows the mesh generated for a bundle with three rings of pins
with two axial layers.

!listing test/tests/mesh/hexagonal_subchannel_mesh/three_rings.i
  block=Mesh

An image of the generated mesh is shown in [tri_mesh]. The elements
are colored by block ID. By default, all
interior channels are added to block 1, all edge channels to block 2,
and all corner channels to block 3.

The following shows the mesh generated for a bundle with two rings
of pins with two axial layers when `volume_mesh = false`.

  block=Mesh

An image of the generate mesh is shown in [tri_mesh_2]. The elements
are again colored by block ID.
