The field is specified with the `field` parameter, which may be one of:

- `pressure`: pressure
- `temperature`: temperature, a.k.a. zeroth passive scalar
- `velocity`: magnitude of velocity
- `velocity_x`: $x$-component of velocity
- `velocity_y`: $y$-component of velocity
- `velocity_z`: $z$-component of velocity
- `velocity_x_squared`: $x$-component of velocity, squared
- `velocity_y_squared`: $y$-component of velocity, squared
- `velocity_z_squared`: $z$-component of velocity, squared
- `velocity_component`: velocity vector dotted against another vector
- `scalar01`: first passive scalar
- `scalar02`: second passive scalar
- `scalar03`: third passive scalar
- `unity`: the value 1.0
