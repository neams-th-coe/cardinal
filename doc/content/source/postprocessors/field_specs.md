The field is specified with the `field` parameter, which may be one of:

- `pressure`
- `temperature`
- `velocity` (magnitude of velocity)
- `velocity_x` ($x$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_y` ($y$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_z` ($z$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_x_squared` ($x$-component of velocity, squared)
- `velocity_y_squared` ($y$-component of velocity, squared)
- `velocity_z_squared` ($z$-component of velocity, squared)
- `velocity_component` (velocity vector projected onto another vector)
- `scalar01` (1st passive scalar)
- `scalar02` (2nd passive scalar)
- `scalar03` (3rd passive scalar)
- `unity` (1.0)
- `function` (a MOOSE-type function from the Cardinal input file)
