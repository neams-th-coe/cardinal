The field is specified with the `field` parameter, which may be one of:

- `pressure`
- `temperature`
- `velocity` (magnitude of velocity)
- `velocity_x` ($x$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_y` ($y$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_z` ($z$-component of velocity)
- `velocity_component` (velocity vector projected onto another vector)
- `scalar01`
- `scalar02`
- `scalar03`
- `unity`
