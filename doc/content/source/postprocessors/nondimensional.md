If running NekRS in non-dimensional form (and you have indicated the
appropriate nondimensional scales by setting `nondimensional = true`
for [NekRSProblem](/problems/NekRSProblem.md)), then the value of this postprocessor
is shown in *dimensional* units. On the otherhand, NekRS scalars (scalar01, scalar02 or scalar03)
are never dimensionalized because their dimensions are problem-dependent.
