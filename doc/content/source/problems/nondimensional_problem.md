NekRS is most often solved in nondimensional form, such that all solution variables
are of order unity by normalizing by problem-specific characteristic scales. However,
most other MOOSE applications use dimensional units. When transferring field data to/from
NekRS or when postprocessing the NekRS solution, it is important for the NekRS solution
to match the dimensional solution of the coupled MOOSE application. For physical intuition,
it is also often helpful in many cases to visualize and interpret a NekRS solution
in dimensional form. This class
automatically performs these conversions between dimensional and non-dimensional form for you, as
well as dimensionalizes the various Nek postpocessors in Cardinal.

If your NekRS input files are in nondimensional form, you must set
`nondimensional = true` and provide the various characteristic scales that were used to
set up the NekRS inputs. Cardinal assumes that the NekRS inputs were nondimensionalized
with the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_ref}
u_i^\dagger\equiv\frac{u_i}{u_{ref}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_ref}
P^\dagger\equiv\frac{P}{\rho_0u_{ref}^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:T_ref}
T^\dagger\equiv\frac{T-T_{ref}}{\Delta T}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:x_ref}
x_i^\dagger\equiv\frac{x_i}{L_{ref}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t_ref}
t^\dagger\equiv\frac{t}{L_{ref}/u_{ref}}
\end{equation}

where $\dagger$ superscripts indicate nondimensional quantities.
`U_ref` is used to specify $u_{ref}$, `T_ref` is used to specify $T_{ref}$,
`dT_ref` is used to specify $\Delta T$, `L_ref` is used to specify $L_{ref}$,
`rho_0` is used to specify $\rho_0$, and `Cp_0` is used to specify $C_{p,0}$
(which does not appear above, but is necessary for scaling a volumetric heat source).
Finally, the mesh mirror must be in the same units as used in the coupled MOOSE application,
so the `scaling` parameter on [NekRSMesh](NekRSMesh.md) must be set to
dimensionalize the nondimensional `.re2` mesh. In other words,
`scaling` must be set to $1/L_{ref}$.

!alert warning
These characteristic scales are used by Cardinal to scale the NekRS solution
into the units that the coupled MOOSE application expects. *You* still need to properly
non-dimensionalize the NekRS input files. That is, you cannot
simply specify the non-dimensional scales in this class and expect a *dimsensional*
NekRS input specification to be converted to non-dimensional form.

For example, suppose your NekRS input is in non-dimensional form. Applying a
[NekVolumeAverage](NekVolumeAverage.md) postprocessor to temperature
would be used to evaluate a volume average of temperature.

If the NekRS inputs are properly non-dimensionalized and the correct scales
are provided to this class, then temperature is non-dimensionalized according
to [eq:T_ref] and volume is non-dimensionalized according to [eq:x_ref], or

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:V_ref}
V^\dagger=\frac{V}{L_{ref}^3}
\end{equation}

The [NekVolumeAverage](NekVolumeAverage.md) postprocessor
is then computed directly on the NekRS solution (in non-dimensional form) to give

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pp}
p_{nd}=\frac{\int T^\dagger dV^\dagger}{\int dV^\dagger}
\end{equation}

where $p_{nd}$ is the value of the postprocessor in non-dimensional form. Before returning the value
of the postprocessor, [eq:pp] is dimensionalized by applying the scales in [eq:T_ref]
and [eq:V_ref] to give the

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pp_dim}
p=\frac{\int T^\dagger dV^\dagger}{\int dV^\dagger}+\frac{T_{ref}}{\Delta T}
\end{equation}

where $p$ is the value of the postprocessor in dimensional form (which
is what is actually returned by the postprocessor).
So when using the `nondimensional = true` feature, all postprocessors
and solution fields extracted from NekRS are represented in dimensional
form in Cardinal.
