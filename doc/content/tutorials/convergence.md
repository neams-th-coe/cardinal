# Assessing Convergence

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Use helper scripts in Cardinal to assess convergence of the OpenMC solution
  and of a general MOOSE application

To access this tutorial, enter the following directory and then also generate
the necessary mesh file,

```
cd cardinal/tutorials/gas_compact
cardinal-opt -i mesh.i --mesh-only
```

This tutorial provides a description of several helper scripts
available in the `cardinal/scripts` directory that can be used for:

- Determining an appropriate number of inactive batches for OpenMC to ensure
  convergence of the fission source and $k$ eigenvalue
- Determining an appropriate cell discretization in OpenMC in the presence
   of thermal feedback
- Determining appropriate mesh convergence of a generic MOOSE application

## Convergence of the OpenMC Model

When building an OpenMC model, there are several parameters that affect
the convergence:

- Number of inactive batches, which must be sufficiently high to ensure
  that the fission distribution and $k$ are converged before beginning
  to tally in the active batches
- Number of active batches, which must be sufficiently high to reach a
  desired uncertainty in $k$ and the tallies
- Cell discretization, such as the number of axial layers in a pincell-type
  geometry or the number of radial cell divisions in a pebble-type geometry,
  such that the actual temperature and density distributions passed into
  OpenMC are converged in terms of the effect on the Monte Carlo transport physics

To ensure that a sufficient number of active batches are used, we recommend
using the [trigger system](OpenMCCellAverageProblem.html#trigger_docs)
in the OpenMC wrapping, which will terminate the number of active batches once
reaching a desired uncertainty in $k$ and/or the `kappa-fission` tally. To
determine an appropriate nuber of inactive batches and a cell discretization,
Cardinal contains several helper scripts. This tutorial describes how to use
these scripts.

!alert note
You will need to install OpenMC's Python API to use the OpenMC convergence
helper scripts. Please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/install.html#installing-python-api).

### Inactive Batches

To determine an appropriate number of inactive batches, you can use the
`scripts/inactive_study.py` script. To run this script, you need:

- A Python script that creates your OpenMC model for you; this Python
  script *must* take `-s` as a boolean argument that indicates a Shannon
  entropy mesh will be added, and `-n <layers>` to indicate the number
  of cell divisions to create
- A Cardinal input file that runs your OpenMC model given some imposed
  temperature and density distribution

For example, to run an inactive cycle study for the model developed
for [the gas compact tutorial](gas_compact.md),
we would run:

```
cd tutorials/gas_compact
python ../../scripts/inactive_study.py -i unit_cell -input openmc.i
```

since the Python script used to generate the OpenMC model is named
`unit_cell.py` and our Cardinal input file is named `openmc.i`. You should edit
the beginning of the `inactive_study.py` script to select the number
of cell layers and number of inactive cycles to consider:

!listing /scripts/inactive_study.py language=python

When the script finishes running, plots of Shannon entropy and $k$, along
with the saved statepoint files from the simulations, will be available
in a directory named `inactive_study`. Below are shown example images of
the Shannon entropy and $k$ plots. If a method to detect convergence of
the fission source is supplied (the default is none), then the script will
report whether the chosen metric succeeded or not. Note, there could be various
factors affecting whether the metric succeeded or not, and based on user choices,
it is possible for a metric to succeed when more batches or more particles per
batch are truly needed. These metrics should be considered along side inspection
of the plots of the Shannon Entropy, which typically takes longer than the
eigenvalue to converge. Having a converged fission source is important so that
when the active batches begin tallying, there is no contamination from the 
source's initial guess impacting the tallies.

### Cell Discretization

To determine an appropriate cell discretization, you can use the
`scripts/layers_study.py` script. To run this script, you need:

- A Python script that creates your OpenMC for you; this Python script
  *must* take `-n <layers>` to indicate the number of cell divisions
  to create
- A Cardinal input file that runs your OpenMC model given some imposed
  temperature and density distribution

In addition, your Cardinal input file must contain a number of postprocessors,
user objects, and vector postprocessors to process the solution to extract
the various scalar and averaged quantities used in the convergence study.
In the `[Problem]` block, you must set `outputs = 'unrelaxed_tally_std_dev'`.
You will also need to copy and paste the following into your input file:

```
[Postprocessors]
  [max_tally_rel_err]
    type = TallyRelativeError
    value_type = max
  []
  [k]
    type = KEigenvalue
  []
  [k_std_dev]
    type = KStandardDeviation
  []
  [max_power]
    type = ElementExtremeValue
    variable = heat_source
    value_type = max
    block = 2
  []
  [min_power]
    type = ElementExtremeValue
    variable = heat_source
    value_type = min
    block = 2
  []

  [proxy_max_power_std_dev]
    type = ElementExtremeValue
    variable = unrelaxed_tally_std_dev
    proxy_variable = heat_source
    value_type = max
    block = 2
  []
  [proxy_min_power_std_dev]
    type = ElementExtremeValue
    variable = unrelaxed_tally_std_dev
    proxy_variable = heat_source
    value_type = min
    block = 2
  []
[]

[UserObjects]
  [average_power_axial]
    type = LayeredAverage
    variable = heat_source
    direction = z
    block = 2
  []
[]

[VectorPostprocessors]
  [power_avg]
    type = SpatialUserObjectVectorPostprocessor
    userobject = average_power_axial
  []
[]
```

!alert warning
When copying the above into your input file, be sure to update the `block` for the
various power postprocessors and user objects
to be the blocks on which the heat source is defined, as well as the `direction`
for the [LayeredAverage](LayeredAverage.md).

For example, to run a cell discretization study for the model developed
for [the gas compact tutorial](gas_compact.md),
we would run:

```
cd tutorials/gas_compact
python ../../scripts/layers_study.py -i unit_cell -input openmc.i
```

since the Python script used to generate the OpenMC model is named
`unit_cell.py` and our Cardinal input file is named `openmc.i`. You should edit
the beginning of the `layers_study.py` script to select the number
of cell layers, number of inactive cycles, and maxium number of active cycles:

!listing /scripts/layers_study.py language=python

When the script finishes running, plots of the maximum power, minimum power,
$k$, and the axial power distribution, along with the saved CSV output from
the simulations, will be available in a directory named `layers_study`. Below
are shown example images of these quantities as a function of the cell
discretization. You would then select the cell discretization scheme to be the
point at which the changes in power and $k$ are sufficiently converged.
