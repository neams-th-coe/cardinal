# KRUSTY - Case A

In this tutorial, you will learn how to couple OpenMC via temperature and heat source feedback to MOOSE for the KRUSTY reactor.

## Multiphysics Coupling
  id=coupling

In this section, OpenMC is coupled to MOOSE for heat source and temperature feedback for the KRUSTY reactor.

### Solid Input Files

The solid phase is solved with the MOOSE Heat Transfer module, and is described in the [solide.i](/tutorials/krusty/KRUSTY/solide.i) input. The mesh exodus file was generated in the Cubit script mentioned before. This file is called inside the `[Mesh]` block:

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=Mesh


The heat transfer module will solve for temperature, which we define as a nonlinear variable and apply a simple uniform initial condition of $1073 K$.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=Variables

The governing equation solved by MOOSE is specified in the `[Kernels]` block with the [HeatConduction](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/HeatConduction.html) and [CoupledForce](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/CoupledForce.html) kernels.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=Kernels


Next, the boundary conditions on the solid are applied. In case A, coupling only OpenMC and MOOSE Heat Transfer Model, the boundary conditions on each heat pipe will be the Dirichlet type, where they have a constant temperature of $1073 K$ and for the "outside" boundary conditions will be a [ConvectiveHeatFluxBC](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/bcs/ConvectiveHeatFluxBC.html) type, where it computes the convective heat flux, with the convective heat transfer coefficient and the far field temperature coupled as material properties.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=BCs

The [Transfer](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html) system in MOOSE is used to communicate variables across applications; a heat source will be computed by OpenMC and applied as a source term in MOOSE. In the opposite direction, MOOSE will compute a temperature that will be applied to the OpenMC geometry. We need to add an auxiliary variable to receive the heat source from OpenMC, which is defined as `power`.


!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=AuxVariables

We also set thermal conductivity values in the blocks: `fuel`, `cavity_center`, `gap_clamp`, `gap_ref`, `gap_sleeve`, `gap_vaccan`. Constant values are used for simplicity.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=Materials


By setting a fixed number of time steps, `dt`, this example will simply run a fixed number of Picard iterations.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  block=Executioner

MOOSE will provide the solid temperature for OpenMC so we add postprocessors to evaluate the average, minimum and maximum temperature in the fuel. 

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/solide.i
  start=Postprocessors

### Neutronics Input Files

We begin by defining a mesh on which OpenMC will receive temperature from the couple MOOSE application.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  block=Mesh

Then, we can define our initial conditions for the temperature, which will be a constant function of $1073 K$

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  start=ICs
  end=Problem

Next, we define the `[Problem]` block, which will describe all objects necessary for the physics solve. In order to replace MOOSE finite element calculations with OpenMC particle transport calculations, we are going to use the [OpenMCCellAverageProblem](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/source/problems/OpenMCCellAverageProblem.html) class. In this model, we specify the total fission power by which to normalize OpenMC's tally results. Next, we indicate which blocks in the `[Mesh]` should be considered for temperature feedback using the `temperature_blocks` parameter. Mesh tallies were used to estimate the heat source, as indicated by `tally_type`.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  block=Problem
  
Next, we add a series of auxiliary variables for solution visualization 

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  block=AuxVariables

In this example, the overall calculation workflow is as follows:

1. Run OpenMC using the initial condition for the temperature.
2. Run MOOSE heat conduction with a given power distribution from OpenMC.
3. Run OpenMC with an updated temperature distribution.
4. Extract the kappa-fission distribution (the recoverable fission energy)
  computed by OpenMC and map in the opposite direction from OpenMC cells
  to all the MOOSE elements that mapped to each cell.

Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until desired convergence of the coupled domain is achieved.
The [MultiApps](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/MultiApps/index.html)
and [Transfers](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/syntax/Transfers/index.html)
blocks describe the interaction between Cardinal and MOOSE. OpenMC is run as the main application, with
MOOSE heat conduction run as the sub-application.


!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  start=MultiApps
  end=Postprocessors

For the heat source transfer from OpenMC, we ensure conservation by requiring that the integral of heat source computed by OpenMC matches the integral of the heat source received by MOOSE. We also add a postprocessor to evaluate the tally relative error and the multiplication factor.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  block=Postprocessors

We do not need to define a number of time steps here, because it is okay to OpenMC use the default `dt` of 1.

!listing /tutorials/krusty/without_sockeye/openmc.i
  start=Executioner


## Execution and Postprocessing

To run the coupled calculation:

```
mpiexec -np 2 cardinal-opt -i openmc.i --n-threads=2
```

This will run both MOOSE and OpenMC with 2 MPI processes and 2 OpenMP threads per rank.
To run the simulation faster, you can increase the parallel processes/threads, or
simply decrease the number of particles used in OpenMC.
When the simulation has completed, you will have created a number of different output files:

- `openmc_out_solid0.e`, an Exodus output with the OpenMC solution and the data
  that was ultimately transferred in/out of OpenMC

First, let's examine how the mapping between OpenMC and MOOSE was established.
When we run with `verbose = true`, you will see the following mapping information displayed:

```
 ===================>     MAPPING FROM OPENMC TO MOOSE     <===================

          T:      # elems providing temperature-only feedback
          rho:    # elems providing density-only feedback
          T+rho:  # elems providing temperature and density feedback
          Other:  # elems which do not provide feedback to OpenMC
                    (but receives a cell tally from OpenMC)
     Mapped Vol:  volume of MOOSE elems each cell maps to
     Actual Vol:  OpenMC cell volume (computed with 'volume_calculation')

 ===================>  OPENMC SUBDOMAIN MATERIAL MAPPING  <====================

      Subdomain:  Subdomain name; if unnamed, we show the ID
       Material:  OpenMC material name(s) in this subdomain; if unnamed, we
                  show the ID. If N duplicate material names, we show the
                  number in ( ).

This demonstrates the OpenMC cells mapped to the MOOSE elements, the auxiliary variables for OpenMC, where we can observe that OpenMC only reads temperature for each subdomain, and the material mapping for OpenMC, which shows the material each subdomain is filled with.
