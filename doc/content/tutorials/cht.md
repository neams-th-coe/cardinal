# Conjugate Heat Transfer Coupling of nekRS and MOOSE

This tutorial describes how to use nekRS to solve for fluid flow and heat transfer
coupled to a solid described by the MOOSE heat conduction module. Two examples are
provided - a section of a reflector block in a [!ac](PB-FHR) and a bare 7-pin
[!ac](SFR) fuel bundle.
