# Conjugate Heat Transfer Coupling of NekRS and MOOSE

This tutorial describes how to use NekRS to solve for fluid flow and heat transfer
coupled to a solid described by the MOOSE heat conduction module. Three examples are
provided - a section of a reflector block in a [!ac](PB-FHR) and a bare 7-pin
[!ac](SFR) fuel bundle with both laminar and turbulent flow.
