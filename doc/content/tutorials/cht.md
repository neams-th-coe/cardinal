# Conjugate Heat Transfer Coupling of nekRS and MOOSE Heat Conduction

This tutorial describes how to use nekRS to solve for fluid flow and heat transfer
coupled to a solid described by the MOOSE heat conduction module. Two examples are
provided - a section of a reflector block in a [!ac](PB-FHR) and a bare 7-pin
[!ac](SFR) fuel bundle.

This tutorial describes how to use Cardinal to perform conjugate heat transfer
calculations using nekRS and the MOOSE heat conduction module for a bare
7-pin [!ac](SFR) bundle. nekRS solves for the fluid phase, while MOOSE solves for
the solid phase.
