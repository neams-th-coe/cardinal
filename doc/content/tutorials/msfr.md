# Multiphysics for a Molten Salt Fast Reactor

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Couple OpenMC and NekRS for modeling a [!ac](MSFR)
- Use DAGMC Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry in OpeNMC
- Use on-the-fly geometry adaptivity ("skinning") to change the OpenMC cells in response to multiphysics feedback

To access this tutorial,

```
cd cardinal/tutorials/msfr
```

This tutorial also requires you to download some mesh and restart files from Box.
Please download the files from the `msfr` folder [here](https://anl.app.box.com/folder/141527707499?s=irryqrx97n5vi4jmct1e3roqgmhzic89).

!alert! note title=Computing Needs
This tutorial requires [!ac](HPC) for running the NekRS model. You will be able to run
the OpenMC model without [!ac](HPC) resources.
Note that you need to have built Cardinal with DAGMC support enabled, by setting
`export ENABLE_DAGMC=true`.
!alert-end!

## Geometry and Computational Model

The geometry consists of an [!ac](MSFR) with geometry from [!cite](rouch).
Volume slices through the NekRS and OpenMC domains are shown in [msr_couple].

As this tutorial is intended primarily to demonstrate on-the-fly geometry skinning,
several important features are neglected such as the transport of [!ac](DNPs).
Future extensions will incorporate material movement in OpenMC driven by velocity
(e.g. from a CFD solver such as NekRS), which allows this assumption to be relaxed
in the future. For geometric simplicity, radial breeder blankets and axial reflectors
are also neglected. The OpenMC model consists of the triangulated surface in
[msr_couple], with a larger bounding box surrounding it which is set to a vacuum
boundary condition.

The nominal operating conditions, as well as the actual conditions used in this
tutorial, are summarized in [table1].
In the present tutorial, the reactor is modeled at a 10% flow, 10% power condition
(i.e. 300 MWth and 1893 kg/s) to be within an approachable range for [!ac](LES).
The NekRS model uses [!ac](LES) at polynomial oder $N=7$ (512 degrees of freedom per element)
for 616000 hexahedral elements, or 315 million grid points. Note in [msr_couple]
that the meshes used by NekRS and OpenMC are very different - the OpenMC domain uses
a triangulated mesh, with about 35000 elements.

!table id=table1 caption=Nominal and simulated operating conditions for the [!ac](MSFR)
| Parameter | Nominal Value | Simulated Value |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Inlet temperature (K) | 898 | 898 |
| Bulk outlet temperature (K) | 998 | 998 |
| Power (MWth) | 3000 | 300 |
| Mass flowrate (kg/s) | 18923 | 1893 |

The heat exchanger and pump in each of the 16 legs are replaced by recycling inlet and turbulent outlet
boundary conditions for velocity. The recycling inlet boundary condition applies the inlet velocity
using the velocity distribution some distance upstream from the *outlet* boundary, essentially
representing the inlet as fully-developed channel flow.
The inlet temperature is then set to a uniform value of 898 K. For simplicity, the NekRS model
uses an incompressible flow model with constant thermophysical properties from [!cite](rouch).
A Boussinesq buoyancy term will be added in future work.
In the OpenMC model, density feedback is approximated by evaluating a thermophysical property correlation
$\rho(T)$ given temperature feedback from NekRS.

### OpenMC Model

OpenMC is used to solve for the neutron transport and power distribution.
The OpenMC model uses DAGMC for ray tracing within triangular surface meshes in $k$-eigenvalue mode.
The OpenMC model is created using OpenMC's Python API. As shown in [msr_couple], the initial
OpenMC model consists of a single large volume, enclosed by one large triangulated mesh surface.
This geometry will be adaptively updated according to multiphysics feedback.

The OpenMC model is created with the `model.py` script. The geometry is created from a
triangulated volume mesh, exported from Cubit. We create a single material to represent
the salt - notice how this contrasts with easlier tutorials for [!ac](CSG) geometries,
where we needed to make a unique material for every unique density region. Later,
Cardinal will automatically create new materials in memory when we skin the geometry.

!listing /tutorials/msfr/model.py

!alert warning
The initial DAGMC model does not contain a graveyard body - so you cannot run this
file in a standalone OpenMC run. Cardinal will create a graveyard for you when
you have skinning enabled.

You can create these XML files by running

```
python model.py
```

or you can simply use the XML files versioned in the directory.

### NekRS Model

NekRS is used to solve the [incompressible Navier-Stokes equations](theory/ins.md) in
[non-dimensional form](theory/nondimensional_ns.md).
The NekRS input files needed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:

- `msfr.re2`: NekRS mesh
- `msfr.par`: High-level settings for the solver, boundary condition mappings to sidesets, and the equations to solve
- `msfr.udf`: User-defined C++ functions for on-line postprocessing and model setup
- `msfr.oudf`: User-defined [!ac](OCCA) kernels for boundary conditions and source terms
- `msfr.usr`: User-defined Fortran functions; these are used to apply the recycling boundary condition.
  Long term, eventually all Nek5000 capabilities will be ported to NekRS, and this fortran file would
  not be necessary.

A detailed description of all of the available parameters, settings, and use
cases for these input files is available on the
[NekRS documentation website](https://nekrsdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Because the purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate Cardinal's capabilities, only the aspects
of NekRS required to understand the present case will be covered.

The mesh is created offline using gmsh, so we simply provide the final mesh on Box.
Next, the `.par` file contains problem setup information. This input solves
for pressure, velocity, and temperature.
In the nondimensional formulation,
the "viscosity" becomes $1/Re$, where $Re$ is the Reynolds number, while the
"thermal conductivity" becomes $1/Pe$, where $Pe$ is the Peclet number. These nondimensional
numbers are used to set various diffusion coefficients in the governing equations
with syntax like `-4.8e4`, which is equivalent in NekRS syntax to $Re=\frac{1}{4.8e4}$.

We use the [high-pass filter](https://nek5000.github.io/NekDoc/problem_setup/filter.html)
 in NekRS for the [!ac](LES), and filter the highest two modes. We set a Reynolds number of
$4.8\times10^{4}$ and a Prandtl number of 17.05. We restart this simulation from a previous
standalone NekRS run, which used a "frozen" power distribution given in the literature
[!cite](rouch).

!listing /tutorials/msfr/msfr.par

Next, the `.udf` file is used to set up a heat source GPU kernel which we will
use to send OpenMC's heat source from Cardinal into NekRS. As we will show later,
this heat source is occupying the first (0-indexed) slot of the scratch space. In
the `UDF_ExecuteStep`, we also do some special copies from some Nek5000 backend data
(special usage here to accomplish the recycling boundary conditions) into the 3rd, 4th,
and 5th slots of the scratch space (the scratch space is zero-indexed).
As shown in the `.par` file, we will read initial
conditions for velocity, pressure, and temperature from a restart file, `restart.fld`,
so we don't need to set any other initial conditions here.

!listing /tutorials/msfr/msfr.udf language=cpp

In the `.oudf` file, we define boundary conditions and any GPU kernels. We see in
`velocityDirichletConditions` how we are setting the inlet velocities equal to
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th slots in the scratch space. The `mooseHeatSource` is a GPU
kernel simply reading from scratch space into the `QVOL` array (which holds a user-defined
volumetric heating).

!listing /tutorials/msfr/msfr.oudf language=cpp

Finally, we have a `.usr` file with Fortran code which accesses from features in Nek5000
which have not yet been fully ported over to NekRS. The code in this file is being used
to apply the recycling boundary conditions.

!listing /tutorials/msfr/msfr.usr language=fortran

## Multiphysics Coupling

In this section, OpenMC and NekRS are coupled for multiphysics modeling of an [!ac](MSFR).
This section describes all input files.

### OpenMC Input Files

The neutron transport is solved using OpenMC. The input file for this portion of the physics is `openmc.i`. We begin by setting up the mesh mirror, which is the same volumetric mesh used
to generate the DAGMC geometry.

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  block=Mesh

Next, we set some initial conditions for temperature and density, because we will run OpenMC first.

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  block=ICs

Next, we define a number of auxiliary variables to be used for diagnostic purposes.
With the exception of the [ParsedAux](ParsedAux.md)
used to compute a fluid density in terms of temperature,
none of the following variables are necessary for coupling, but they will allow us to visualize how data is mapped from OpenMC to the mesh mirror. The [CellTemperatureAux](CellTemperatureAux.md)
and [CellDensityAux](CellDensityAux.md)
will display the OpenMC cell temperatures and densities (after volume-averaging from Cardinal).

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  start=AuxVariables
  end=Problem

Next, the `[Problem]` and `[Tallies]` blocks define all the parameters related to coupling
OpenMC to MOOSE. We will send temperature and density to OpenMC, and extract
power using a [MeshTally](MeshTally.md). We set a number of relaxation settings to use
Dufek-Gudowski relaxation, which will progressively ramp the number of
particles used in the simulation (starting at 5000) so that we selectively
apply computational effort only after the thermal-fluid physics are reasonably
well converged. Finally, we will be "skinning" the geometry on-the-fly
by providing the `skinner` user object (of type
[MoabSkinner](MoabSkinner.md)).

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  block=Problem

After every Picard iteration, the skinner will group the elements in the mesh
according to their temperature and density. For this tutorial, we will group the
elements according to temperature by 15 different bins, ranging from a minimum
temperature of 800 K up to a maximum temperature of 1150 K. We will then also
bin by density, so that we will have a second grouping according to density.
Then, we will create a new OpenMC cell for each unique combination of temperature
and density, and re-generate the DAGMC mesh surfaces that bound these regions.

Next, we create a NekRS sub-application, and set up transfers of data between OpenMC and NekRS.
These transfers will send fluid temperature and density from NekRS up to OpenMC, and a power distribution to NekRS.
We will use sub-cycling, and only send data to/from NekRS at those synchronization points,
by using the `synchronize_in` postprocessor transfer.

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  start=MultiApps
  end=Postprocessors

Finally, we will use a [Transient](Transient.md) executioner and add a number of postprocessors for diagnostic purposes. We set the "time step" size in OpenMC
to be equal to 2000 times the (dimensional) NekRS time step size, so we are essentially
running 2000 NekRS time steps for each OpenMC $k$-eigenvalue solve.

!listing tutorials/msfr/openmc.i
  start=Postprocessors

### Fluid Input Files

The fluid mass, momentum, and energy transport physics are solved using NekRS. The input file
for this portion of the physics is `nek.i`. We begin by defining a number of file-local constants and by setting
up the [NekRSMesh](NekRSMesh.md) mesh mirror. Because we are coupling NekRS via volumetric heating
to OepNMC, we need to use a volumetric mesh mirror. The characteristic length chosen for
the NekRS files is already 1 m, so we do not need to scale the mesh in any way.

!listing tutorials/msfr/nek.i
  end=Problem

The bulk of the NekRS wrapping is specified with [NekRSProblem](NekRSProblem.md).
The NekRS input files are in non-dimensional form, whereas all other coupled applications
use dimensional units. The various `*_ref` and `*_0` parameters define the characteristic
scales that were used to non-dimensionalize the NekRS input.

!listing /tutorials/msfr/nek.i
  block=Problem

Then, we simply set up a [Transient](Transient.md)
executioner with the [NekTimeStepper](NekTimeStepper.md).

!listing tutorials/msfr/nek.i
  start=Executioner

## Execution

To run the input files,

```
mpiexec -np 150 cardinal-opt -i openmc.i
```

This will produce a number of output files,

- `openmc_out.e`, OpenMC simulation results
- `openmc_out_nek0.e`, NekRS simulation results, mapped to a `SECOND` order Lagrange basis
- `moab_skins_*.h5m`, OpenMC cell surfaces (in units of centimeters), which can be converted to `.vtk` format using the `mbconvert` script
- `msfr0.f*`, NekRS output files

[msfr_results] shows the OpenMC power (on a mesh tally), NekRS fluid temperature, and
the OpenMC cell temperatures for the last Picard iteration. The black lines delineate the edges of
the OpenMC cells, which have been adaptively generated according to the multiphysics feedback.
