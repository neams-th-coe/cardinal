# Postprocessing/Extracting the NekRS solution

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Postprocess a NekRS simulation (both "live" runs as well as from field files)
- Extract the NekRS solution into [MooseVariables](MooseVariable.md)
  for use with other MOOSE objects

Many of the features covered in this tutorial have already been touched upon
and used in the preceding NekRS tutorials. The purpose of this dedicated tutorial
is to explain more specific use cases or complex combinations of postprocessing/extraction
features. We will use a variety of input cases, and will not focus too much
on the physics setup - just the postprocessing and data extraction features.
For simplicity, many of the examples shown here just deal with thin wrappings
of NekRS via [NekRSStandaloneProblem](NekRSStandaloneProblem.md) -
however, all features shown here can also be used in a coupled sense via
[NekRSProblem](NekRSProblem.md).

## Viewing the NekRS Mesh

NekRS uses a custom mesh format (with the `.re2` extension). This file cannot
natively be viewed in visualization software such as Paraview. Standalone NekRS
users have to run at least one CFD time step, and then can only visualize the
*output file*. This can be tedious if you need to achieve a viable CFD solve
just to visualize a mesh.

Cardinal provides a way to visualize the NekRS CFD mesh. Simply
set `exact = true` for [NekRSMesh](NekRSMesh.md)
and then run in `--mesh-only` mode. For example, you can create a small Cardinal
input file,

!listing /test/tests/nek_mesh/exact/exact_volume.i

And then run in `--mesh-only` mode.

```
cd test/tests/nek_mesh/exact
cardinal-opt -i exact.i --mesh-only
```

## Loading a NekRS Time History into Exodus

To access this tutorial,

```
cd cardinal/tutorials/load_from_exodus

```

For applications with "one-way" coupling of NekRS to MOOSE, you may wish
to use a time history of the NekRS solution as a boundary condition/source
term in another MOOSE application.
For instance, for thermal striping applications, it is often a reasonable
approximation to solve a NekRS CFD simulation as a standalone case, and then
apply a time history of NekRS's wall temperature as a boundary condition to a solid mechanics solve.
Cardinal allows you to
write the NekRS solution to an Exodus file that can then be loaded to provide
a time history of the CFD solution to another application. In this example, we will
use the following Cardinal input file:

!listing /tutorials/load_from_exodus/nek.i

We incidate that we want to output the NekRS temperature onto a volume mesh mirror
of second order and output to Exodus format. Then, we simply use a
[NekRSStandaloneProblem](NekRSStandaloneProblem.md)
and [NekTimeStepper](NekTimeStepper.md) to run the NekRS CFD
calculation through the Cardinal wrapper. You can run this example with

```
mpiexec -np 4 cardinal-opt -i nek.i
```

which will create an output file named `nek_out.e`, which contains the time
history of the NekRS temperature solution on the volume mesh mirror.

In order to load the entire time history of the Nek solution, we need a separate
input file that will essentailly act as the surrogate for performing the Nek solution
(by instead loading from the Exodus file dumped earlier).
First, we use the dumped
output file directly as the mesh.
Because this run won't actually solve any physics (either with NekRS or with MOOSE).
we next need to turn the solve off.

!listing /tutorials/load_from_exodus/load_nek.i
  start=Mesh
  end=UserObjects

Then, to load the solution from the `nek_out.e`, we use a
[SolutionUserObject](SolutionUserObject.md).
This user object will read the `temp` variable from the provided `mesh` file
(which we set to our output file from the NekRS run). We omit the `timestep` parameter
that is sometimes provided to the
[SolutionUserObject](SolutionUserObject.md)
so that this user object will *interpolate* in time based on the time stepping specified
in the `[Executioner]` block.

This user object only loads the Exodus file into a user object - to then get that
solution into an [AuxVariable](AuxVariables/index.md)
appropriate for transferring to another application or using in other MOOSE objects,
we simply convert the user object to an auxiliary variable using a
[SolutionAux](SolutionAux.md).
This will load the `temp` variable from the [SolutionUserObject](SolutionUserObject.md)
and place it into the new variable we have named `nek_temp`.

!listing /tutorials/load_from_exodus/load_nek.i
  start=UserObjects
  end=Executioner

Finally, we "run" this application by specifying a [Transient](Transient.md)
executioner. The time stepping scheme we specify here just indicates at which time
step the data in the `nek_out.e` file should be interpolated to. For instance, if you ran
NekRS with a time step of 1e-3 seconds, but only want to couple NekRS's temperature to a
solid mechanics solve on a resolution of 1e-2 seconds, then simply set the time step size
in this file to `dt = 1e-2`. Finally, we specify a Exodus output in this file, which you can
use to see that the temperature from `nek_out.e` was correctly loaded (`nek_temp` in
`load_nek_out.e` matches `temp` in `nek_out.e`).

## Binned Spatial Postprocessors

To access this tutorial,

```
cd cardinal/tutorials/subchannel
```

Cardinal contains features for postprocessing the NekRS solution in spatial
"bins" using user objects. Available user objects include:

- [NekBinnedPlaneIntegral](NekBinnedPlaneIntegral.md):
  compute plane integrals over regions of space
- [NekBinnedPlaneAverage](NekBinnedPlaneAverage.md):
  compute plane averages over regions of space
- [NekBinnedSideIntegral](NekBinnedSideIntegral.md):
  compute integrals over sidesets with subdivisions in space
- [NekBinnedSideAverage](NekBinnedSideAverage.md):
  compute averages over sidesets with subdivisions in space
- [NekBinnedVolumeIntegral](NekBinnedVolumeIntegral.md):
  compute volume integrals over regions of space
- [NekBinnedVolumeAverage](NekBinnedVolumeAverage.md):
  compute volume averages over regions of space

These user objects can be used for operations such as:

- Averaging the solution over $\theta$ for axisymmetric geometries
- Extracting homogenized solutions, such as for
  feeding volume-averaged quantities to a 3-D Pronghorn model
- Representing the solution in a different discretization form, such as
  a finite volume discretization of a subchannel geometry

An example of averaging over axisymmetric geometries was provided in
[Tutorial 1](nekrs_standalone.md). Here, we will demonstrate
averaging the NekRS solution in a fuel bundle geometry according to a subchannel
discretization.

The model consists of a 7-pin
[!ac](SFR) fuel bundle; the mesh is shown in [bundle]. Our goal is to obtain
subchannel-averaged and gap-averaged temperatures and velocities on a mesh that reflects a subchannel discretization.
Note that the NekRS mesh does *not* have elements that
align with the usual subchannel boundaries; therefore we require
the ability to map the NekRS quadrature points to "bins" that represent
our different regions of interest (subchannels and subchannel gaps).

  style=width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

The NekRS input files use typical settings;
the only setting of note is that for simplicity and ease of illustration, we turn
the actual physics solve off by setting `solver = none` for the velocity and temperature in
the `sfr_7pin.par` file.

!listing /tutorials/subchannel/sfr_7pin.par

Then, we specify dummy velocity, pressure, and temperature initial conditions, just for the
sake of demonstrating the subchannel averaging methods.

!listing /tutorials/subchannel/sfr_7pin.udf language=cpp

For instance, the temperature in the NekRS field files will remain fixed at the
given function initial condition of

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:one}
T=x+y+3z
\end{equation}

while the velocity is set to a swirl velocity with an angular component that increases
with $r$ and zero radial component.

We will run this NekRS case with a thin wrapper input file, shown below.

!listing /tutorials/subchannel/nek.i

Of note are the user objects, multiapps, and transfers. In this file, we will compute
three different postprocessing operations:

- **Average temperature over subchannel volumes**:
  We will use a user object to
  conduct a binned spatial average of the NekRS temperature. We first form these bins
  as the product of unique indices for each subchannel with unique indices for each
  axial layer. The [HexagonalSubchannelBin](HexagonalSubchannelBin.md)
  object assigns a unique ID for each subchannel, for which
  we must provide various geometric parameters describing the fuel bundle. The
  [LayeredBin](LayeredBin.md) object assigns a unique ID for equal-size
  layers in a given direction; here, we specify 7 axial layers. Finally, we
  will compute a volume average of the NekRS temperature with the
  [NekBinnedVolumeAverage](NekBinnedVolumeAverage.md) object, which
  constructs bins as the outer product of individual bin distributions. Because the NekRS mesh
  in [bundle] has 6 elements in the axial direction, but we have specified that we
  want to average across 7 axial layers, we set `map_space_by_qp = true`. This setting
  will essentially apply a delta function of unity in each layer when forming the
  integral. Setting `map_space_by_qp = false` instead maps each NekRS element to
  a bin according to its centroid (which for this particular example would result in
  some of the axial bins not mapping to any elements, since the NekRS mesh is coarser
  than the specified number of bins).

- **Average temperature over subchannel gaps**:
  We form the bins as the product of unique
  indices for each subchannel gap with unique indices for each axial layers.
  The [HexagonalSubchannelGapBin](HexagonalSubchannelGapBin.md)
  object assigns a unique ID for each subchannel gap ID in a hexagonal fuel bundle. The
  [LayeredBin](LayeredBin.md) object then assigns a unique ID for equal-size
  layers in the axial direction; for simplicity, we reuse the same axial binning distribution
  that we selected for the volume averages. Finally, we compute the planar averages of the
  NekRS temperature with the [NekBinnedPlaneAverage](NekBinnedPlaneAverage.md)
  object, which takes an arbitrary number of individual bin distributions (with the
  only requirement being that one and only one of these distribution is a "side" distribution, which
  for this example is the `HexagonalSubchannelGapBin`).

- **Average the normal velocity over subchannel gaps**:
  We reuse the same previous bins, but set
  `field = velocity_component` for a [NekBinnedPlaneAverage](NekBinnedPlaneAverage.md).

The [SpatialUserObjectVectorPostprocessor](SpatialUserObjectVectorPostprocessor.md)
outputs the bin values for the user object to the CSV format
specified in the `[Outputs]` block. These values are ordered in the same manner
that the bins are defined.

Recall that the NekRS mesh does *not* respect the subchannel discretization,
or the desired number of axial averaging layers. Therefore, if we want to properly
visualize the results of the user object, we transfer the user object to two
different sub-applications
which serve the sole purpose of user object visualization. We use two different
sub-applications because one sub-app will use a mesh that perfectly represents
the *volumes* of the channels, while the second sub-app will use a mesh that perfectly
represents the *gaps* between the channels.

The application that will be used
to view the volume results on the channels is shown below.
This sub-application
constructs a subchannel mesh with the [HexagonalSubchannelMesh](HexagonalSubchannelMesh.md)
to receive the user object into a variable named `average_T`
and the three components of the gap normal velocity as `uo_x`,
`uo_y`, and `uo_z`. We set `solve = false` so that
no physics solve occurs.

!listing /tutorials/subchannel/subchannel.i

The application that will be used to view the gap results is shown below.
This sub-application
constructs a subchannel mesh with the [HexagonalSubchannelGapMesh](HexagonalSubchannelGapMesh.md)
to receive the user object into a variable named `average_T`. We set `solve = false` so that
no physics solve occurs.

!listing /tutorials/subchannel/subchannel_gap.i

This input can be run as,

```
mpiexec -np 4 cardinal-opt -i nek.i
```

which will run with 4 MPI ranks. Because we don't specify any output
block in the Nek-wrapping input file itself, the only output files are:

- `nek_out_subchannel0.e`, which shows the channel-averaged temperature on a subchannel
  discretization
- `nek_out_subchannel_gap0.e`, which shows the gap-averaged quantities on the
  gaps in a subchannel discretization

The temperature initial condition that we set
from NekRS is shown in [sub], along with the result of the subchannel volume and gap averaging. Note that
because we transferred the user object to a sub-application with a mesh that respects
our axial bins, we perfectly represent the channel-wise average temperatures.

By applying the "glyph" filter in Paraview, we can visualize the gap-normal
velocity with arrows. Otherwise, the result of the `avg_gap_velocity` user object is a *magnitude*,
which would need to be combined with the gap unit normals
(defined in the [HexagonalSubchannelGapBin](HexagonalSubchannelGapBin.md) documentation)
to visualize the direction.

For other geometries, other binning strategies can be used.
Available user objects for specifying spatial bins are:

- [HexagonalSubchannelGapBin](HexagonalSubchannelGapBin.md)
- [HexagonalSubchannelBin](HexagonalSubchannelBin.md)
- [LayeredBin](LayeredBin.md)
- [LayeredGapBin](LayeredGapBin.md)
- [RadialBin](RadialBin.md)

For example, you can compute an average over a number of planes perpendicular
to the $x$ axis, split into two layers, by combining the two bin user objects
shown below.
