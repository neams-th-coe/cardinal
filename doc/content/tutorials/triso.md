# Tutorial 2B: TRISO Pebbles in a Lattice

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Establish coupling between OpenMC and MOOSE for nested universe OpenMC models
- Couple OpenMC solves in units of centimeters with MOOSE solves in units of meters

This tutorial describes how to use Cardinal to perform temperature and heat
source coupling of OpenMC and MOOSE for modeling fuel pebbles in a lattice.

!alert note
This tutorial assumes that you have read [Tutorial 2A](pincell1.md) to give most of the
background for how the OpenMC-MOOSE temperature and heat source coupling works.
