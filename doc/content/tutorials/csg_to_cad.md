## Geometry and Computational Models

This model consists of a simplified version of the KRUSTY reactor. The neutronics model contains the fuel, heat pipes, and several layers of radial insulation and reflector materials. Simplified material compositions have been used, and many ex-core components have been removed for the sake of a simpler tutorial.

A conceptual image of the (i) fully-detailed KRUSTY model (background transparent image) and the simplified [!ac](CSG) models used in this tutorial (foreground) is shown below.

## Converting CSG to CAD using Coreform Cubit

The [OpenMC CAD adapter](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc_cad_adapter)
provides the capability to convert OpenMC cells to CAD parts in the form of a
Cubit journal file that can be imported into Cubit. These CAD models can then be
exported to various other CAD formats supported by Cubit (ACIS, IGES, STEP,
etc.) or parts can be meshed for use in other simulations -- as is the case in
this tutorial.

OpenMC provides a plotting utility, which is useful for exploring CSG models,
but it is limited to axis-aligned slices of the geometry. CAD and meshing
utilities commonly support interactive rendering of parts, which is useful for
debugging geometry problems as well as verifying the shape and/or placement of
neutronics cells.

To generate a journal file of the KRUSTY model provided here with the CAD adapter,
run the following command:

```
openmc_to_cad original_model.xml -w 1000 1000 1000 -c 1
```

This will produce two files, `openmc.jou` and `openmc_cell1.jou`, that contain
the entire KRUSTY model and cell 1, the fuel region, respectively. It is
interesting to view the full model in CAD, but we will only need the first cell
for the purposes of this tutorial.

To open and import the full model in to Cubit, select the "Play journal file" button

```
Cubit> playback "openmc.jou"
```

!alert! note title=Cubit syntax
The quotes around the file name in the block above are meaningful in Cubit's console and should not be omitted.
!alert-end!

The model should then appear in Cubit.

  style=width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

The model can then be examined for accuracy, with the material assignments appering
as groups in the model tree.

The ability to interactively explore the model as CAD is extremely useful for
visualization and debugging of a CSG model, which can be difficult to keep track
of when relying on a mental model supported by 2D slices from native plotting
utilities.

However, for this example we only need a single volume to couple heating in the
center fuel volume (contained in the group labeled "mat:U-7.65Mo Fuel"). Let's instead
import that single cell into Cubit.

```
Cubit> reset
Cubit> playback "openmc_cell1.jou"
```

  caption=Fuel volume of the KRUSTY reactor imported into Cubit.
  id=krusty_fuel_only
  style=width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

Next we'll create 2 meshes:

1. A surface mesh of triangle for the DAGMC geometry. This will represent the
   geometry boundaries for particle transport
2. A volumetric mesh for a heating tally and decomposition based on the temperature field produced by heat conduction in MOOSE.

### Generate the DAGMC Surface Mesh

For the DAGMC mesh, we'll apply Cubit's trimesh scheme to all the
surfaes of the fuel volume. This will produce a watertight mesh for particle
transport. Normally the coarse mesh settings would be used to build the DAGMC
mesh, but in this case we'll disable that setting to obtain triangles with a
better aspect ratio for the tetrahedral mesh we'll create later.

```
Cubit> set trimesher coarse off
Cubit> set trimesher split overconstrained edges on
Cubit> surface all scheme trimesh
Cubit> mesh surface all
```

!media krusty_fuel_surface_mesh.png
  caption=The surface mesh of the fuel volume.
  id=krusty_surface_mesh
  style=width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

Now that this is complete, we'll want to make sure the metadata converted from
the OpenMC model is handled appropriately. To do this we'll use some capabilites
from the [DAGMC toolbar](https://github.com/pshriwise/cubit-dagmc-toolbar) which
can be added to Cubit. One of the capabilities is the conversion of group-based
metadata to blocks and materials. We'll perform this conversion by clicking the button with the tooltip "Materials to Block Assignments".

**Note: that this conversion can also be accomplished based on instructions found
in previous Coreform Cubit webinars on modern DAGMC workflows.**

  id=dagmc_mats_to_block
  style=width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

This mesh can now be exported to the `.h5m` format supported by DAGMC.

```
Cubit> export dagmc "krusty_fuel.h5m"
```

**Note: This can also be accomplished in Cubit's export GUI.**

### Generate the Cardinal Mesh

When generating the Cardinal mesh, we want to ensure that the triangles of the
DAGMC mesh correspond to the triangles used in the DAGMC mesh. Generating both
meshes in Cubit allows us to guarantee that the boundaries of the two meshes are
conformal. This mesh will be used to both tally heating in OpenMC and evaluate
heat conductioon in MOOSE.

```
Cubit> set duplicate block elements on
Cubit> tetmesh tri all make block
```

  caption=Tetrahedral mesh of the fuel volume.
  id=krusty_fuel_vol_mesh
  style=width:30%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

Next, the mesh sideset "heat_pipes" can be added. Cardinal will expect to find
on this sideset on the mesh.

```
Cubit> sideset 1 add surface 233 to 240
Cubit> sideset 1 name "heat_pipes"
```

  caption=Generation of the sideset for Cardinal's heat conduction boundary condition.
  id=heat_pipes_sideset
  style=width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;halign:center

This mesh can now be exported for use in multiphysics copuling.

```
Cubit> export mesh "/Users/pshriwise/krusty.e"
```

## Multiphysics Coupling

We have built a hybrid [!ac](CAD) and [!ac](CSG) model of the KRUSTY reactor in OpenMC,
along with a volume mesh for tallying and solving heat conduction. In this section,
we briefly describe the input files used to couple heat conduction to neutronics.

### MOOSE Heat Conduction

We solve for the fuel temperature using the finite element method using MOOSE.
We will solve using the volume mesh produced from Cubit. This mesh is identical
to the mesh which OpenMC will use for tallying, but does not striclty need to be
(it can be entirely different, and most other tutorials demonstrate this feature). But
in this case, we will for simplicity use an identical mesh.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/fuel.i
  block=Mesh

We will solve for temperature, with a variable `T`. The power density will be
supplied by OpenMC, so we create a variable named `power` in this file in order
to receive that field. The OpenMC tally will be a constant value in every mesh
element, so we define this variable to match this basis.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/fuel.i
  start=Variables
  end=Kernels

Next, we specify the governing equation and boundary conditions. We will solve
for the steady-state temperature distribution

\begin{equation}
-\nabla\cdot k\nabla T=\dot{q}
\end{equation}

We use the [HeatConduction](HeatConduction.md) and [CoupledForce](CoupledForce.md) kernels to define the Laplacian
kernel and the coupled power term, respectively. For boundary conditions, we apply
a constant temperature of 800 on the surface of the heat pipes.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/fuel.i
  start=Kernels
  end=Postprocessors

Lastly, we need to specify a value for the thermal conductivity. We will set this
to a constant value, for simplicity.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/fuel.i
  block=Materials

Finally, we need to specify how to solve this equation. We will use a transient
executioner, which will allow us to solve the equation multiple times. We also
indicate the output file format (exodus). For the sake of normalizing the power
we receive from OpenMC, we also add a postprocessor to compute the total integral
of power - while we don't strictly need this because our meshes are identical
between OpenMC and MOOSE for this problem, having this block here would be necessary
if OpenMC and MOOSE were using different meshes, to guarantee power conservation.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/fuel.i
  start=Postprocessors

### OpenMC Neutron Transport

Our input file to run OpenMC within a MOOSE simulation will look similar to
the previous input file syntax. First, we now have a problem block to inform
MOOSE to replace it's typical finite element solver with calls to OpenMC
$k$-eigenvalue runs. We will have temperature feedback to OpenMC on block 1,
and we add two mesh tallies. This will tally the `kappa_fission` local power
deposition and the `flux` from OpenMC and map them to the mesh used in the mesh block. Other settings in the problem block refer to how to normalize the tallies
from OpenMC into meaningful engineering units (W/volume for heating terms,
and neutrons/area/time for flux).

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/openmc.i
  end=UserObjects

We will dynamically modify the OpenMC geometry by "skinning" with the
[MoabSkinner](MoabSkinner.md) object. For simplicity, we will lump elements into new cells by contouring into 4 intervals between temperatures of 800 K and 1000 K.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/openmc.i
  block=UserObjects

Next, we specify how to pass data between OpenMC and the finite element heat
conduction solver in the `fuel.i` input file. We will run the heat conduction solver
as a sub-application. On every time step, we will pass temperature (into OpenMC)
and the heating tally (out of OpenMC) as listed in the transfers block. The
other details listed in this section are optimizations for faster transfers
(`search_value_conflicts = false`) and details on the source/receiver variable
names in each file and which postprocessors to use to ensure power conservation.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/openmc.i
  start=MultiApps
  end=ICs

Next, we set some initial conditions, since OpenMC will run first. We set a
constant initial temperature of 800 K. Lastly, we indicate the run settings -
we will run OpenMC three times, and output all results to Exodus.

!listing /tutorials/csg_to_cad/openmc.i
  start=ICs

## Execution and Postprocessing

To run the coupled calculation,

```
mpiexec -np 2 cardinal-opt -i openmc.i --n-threads=2
```

This will run both MOOSE and OpenMC with 2 MPI processes and 2 OpenMP threads per rank.
To run the simulation faster, you can increase the parallel processes/threads, or
simply decrease the number of particles used in OpenMC.
When the simulation has completed, you will have created a number of different output files:

- `openmc_out.e`: Exodus output file with all variables in the `openmc.i` file
- `openmc_out_conduction0.e`: Exodus output file with all variables in the `fuel.i` file
