# Tutorial 9A: Multiphysics Coupling for an SFR Pin Bundle

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Couple OpenMC, NekRS, and MOOSE for steady-state multiphysics simulations

This tutorial describes how to use Cardinal to perform temperature, density,
and fission power coupling of OpenMC, NekRS, and MOOSE for a 7-pin [!ac](SFR)
pin bundle. This tutorial is an adaptation of the [!ac](SFR) modeling
performed in [!cite](novak2022). For pedagogical purposes,
several simplifications are made
in the formulation of the geometry, material properties, and operating conditions
so that the emphasis of the computational model remains focused on the
multiphysics coupling and data transfers.
