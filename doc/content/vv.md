# Verification and Validation

Verification and validation of Cardinal is essential to justify relevance of this application
to end-use applications in energy. Below, we collect a summary of the [!ac](VV)
cases included in Cardinal; each includes a brief documentation describing the test case,
the input files, and [!ac](VV) results. Cardinal and its dependencies have a very rich
history of [!ac](VV), and the cases shown on this page only represent those test cases
which are included in Cardinal's [!ac](VV) suite; extending this page is actively funded
through the [!ac](DOE) [!ac](NEAMS) Program.
