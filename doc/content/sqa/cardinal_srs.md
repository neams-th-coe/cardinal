!template! item key=system-scope
!! system-scope-begin
Cardinal is an application for performing high-fidelity simulation of nuclear systems
incorporating Monte Carlo neutron-photon transport and/or spectral element [!ac](CFD).
These physics can be combined with one another and with the [MOOSE modules](Modules/index.md) to accomplish "multiphysics" simulation. High-fidelity simulations can also be
performed independently, for the purpose of data postprocessing, to generate constitutive
models suitable for lower-fidelity tools, a process referred to as "multiscale" simulation.

Interfaces to other MOOSE-based codes, including systems-level thermal-hydraulics (SAM),
heat pipe flows (Sockeye), and fuel performance (Bison) are also optionally included
to support Cardinal simulations. Cardinal enables high-fidelity modeling of
heat transfer, fluid flow, passive scalar transport, fluid-structure interaction,
nuclear heating, tritium breeding, shielding effectiveness, material activation,
material damage, and sensor response. The [syntax/MultiApps/index.md]
is leveraged to allow for the multiscale, multiphysics coupling. Further, other MOOSE capabilities in the [modules](Modules/index.md), such as the [Stochastic Tools Module](stochastic_tools/index.md) enable engineering studies with uncertainty quantification
and sensitivity analysis.
Cardinal therefore supports design, safety, engineering, and research projects.

!template! item key=system-purpose
!! system-purpose-begin
The purpose of Cardinal is to perform fully integrated, high-fidelity, multiphysics simulations of nuclear energy systems at high-fidelity with a
variety of materials, system configurations,
and component designs in order to better understand system performance.
Cardinal's main goal is to bring together the combined multiphysics capabilities of
the MOOSE ecosystem with leading high-performance tools for radiation transport
(OpenMC) and Navier-Stokes fluid flow (NekRS) in an open platform for research,
safety assessment, engineering, and design studies of nuclear energy systems.

!template! item key=assumptions-and-dependencies
{{app}} has no constraints on hardware and software beyond those of the MOOSE framework, MOOSE modules, OpenMC, NekRS, and DAGMC, as listed in their
respective [!ac](SRS) documents, which are accessible through the links at
the beginning of this document.

{{app}} provides access to a number of code objects that perform computations, such as particle
transport, material behavior, and boundary conditions. These objects each make their own physics-based
assumptions, such as the units of the inputs and outputs. Those assumptions are described in the
documentation for those individual objects.

!template! item key=user-characteristics
{{app}} has two main classes of users:

- +{{app}} Developers+: These are the core developers of {{app}}. They are responsible
  for designing, implementing, and maintaining the software, while following and enforcing its software development standards. These scientists and engineers modify or add capabilities to {{app}}
  for their own purposes, which may include research or extending its capabilities. They will typically
  have a background in thermal-fluids and/or radiation transport, as well as in modeling and simulation techniques.
- +Analysts+: These are users that run {{app}} to run simulations, but do not develop code.
  The primary interface of these users with {{app}} is the input files that define their
  simulations. These users may interact with developers of the system requesting new features and
  reporting bugs found.

!template! item key=information-management
{{app}} as well as the core MOOSE framework, OpenMC, NekRS, and DAGMC are publicly available
on an appropriate repository hosting site. Day-to-day backups and security services will be provided
by the hosting service. More information about backups of the public repository on [!ac](INL)-hosted
services can be found on the following page: [sqa/github_backup.md]

!template! item key=packaging
No special requirements are needed for packaging or shipping any media containing the {{app}} source code.
However, some other applications that use {{app}} may be export-controlled, in which case all export control restrictions must be adhered to when
packaging and shipping media.

!template! item key=reliability
The regression test suite will cover at least 90% of all lines of code at all times. Known
regressions will be recorded and tracked (see [#maintainability]) to an independent and
satisfactory resolution.
