# HPC Systems

The Cardinal development team regularly builds and runs Cardinal on a number
of [!ac](HPC) systems. To help streamline the compilation
process for other users, this section collects instructions for the modules and any
systems-specific settings for a variety of [!ac](HPC) systems. Because default modules and
settings change on [!ac](HPC) systems with time, the instructions below may become deprecated.
The date at which the settings were last tested is given for each system.
The absence of a particular [!ac](HPC) system from this list does not imply that Cardinal will not
build/run on that system - but only that no instructions have yet been compiled for that system.
Also please note that in addition to these provided module and environment settings,
you must also follow the build instructions on the
[Getting Started](start.md) page.

## LCRC at ANL

The following `~/.bashrc` allows you to compile Cardinal on
[LCRC](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/systems/resources/) at ANL. Please

export NEKRS_HOME=$HOME/cardinal/install

module purge
module load gcc/8.2.0-g7hppkz
module load intel-mpi/2018.4.274-ozfo327
module load intel-mkl/2018.4.274-2amycpi
module load cmake/3.14.2-gvwazz3
module load hdf5/1.8.16-mz7lmxh
module load anaconda3

export CC=mpicc
export CXX=mpicxx
export FC=mpif90
```

## MCS at ANL

## Nek5k at ANL

Nek5k uses conda to help set up the environment needed to compile and run Cardinal.
