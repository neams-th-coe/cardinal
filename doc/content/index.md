# Cardinal

Cardinal is a wrapping of the GPU-based spectral element CFD code
[nekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS) and the Monte Carlo particle
transport code [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) within the
MOOSE framework. Cardinal is intended for providing high-resolution
thermal-hydraulics and/or particle transport feedback to MOOSE multiphysics
simulations.

Cardinal is designed with high performance computing and flexibility in mind.
