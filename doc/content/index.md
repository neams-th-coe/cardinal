Cardinal is a wrapping of the GPU-oriented spectral element [!ac](CFD) code
[NekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/NekRS) and the Monte Carlo particle
transport code [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) within the
MOOSE framework. Cardinal provides high-resolution
thermal-hydraulics and/or radiation transport feedback to MOOSE multiphysics
simulations. Multiphysics feedback is implemented in a geometry-agnostic manner
which eliminates
the need for rigid one-to-one mappings. A generic data transfer implementation
also allows NekRS and OpenMC to couple to *any* MOOSE application, enabling
a broad set of multiphysics capabilities. Simulations can also leverage combinations
of MPI, OpenMP, and GPU resources.

!card media/full_pbr.png title=Pebble Bed Reactors
Full-core PBR simulations with NekRS [!cite](lan); MOOSE finite element heat conduction is coupled with NekRS and OpenMC for up to 127,000 pebbles [!cite](fischer_2021). Figure shows fluid velocity predicted by NekRS.

!card media/cooling_plates.png title=Fusion Components
Multiphysics model of a Helium Cooled Lead Lithium (HCLL) tritium breeder blanket module from the EU DEMO using OpenMC and MOOSE heat conduction [!cite](novak_2023). Image shows the solid temperature in the cooling plates. The OpenMC model uses CAD geometry, capable of highly complex geometry.

!card media/assembly_solid_temp_fine.png title=Prismatic Gas Reactors
Full-core multiphysics model of a high temperature gas reactor using OpenMC-THM-MOOSE [!cite](novak2022_cardinal); figure shows the OpenMC power and MOOSE solid temperature.

!card media/msr_skin.png title=Molten Salt Reactors
Multiphysics model of a Molten Salt Fast Reactor using NekRS-OpenMC [!cite](novak_2023). OpenMC geometry uses CAD, with on-the-fly adaptive re-generation of the OpenMC cells according to contours in temperature and/or density feedback.

!card media/mrad.png title=Heat Pipe Reactors
Multiphysics model of a Heat Pipe Microreactor using OpenMC-MOOSE-Sockeye [!cite](eltawila).

!card media/sfr_fluid_planes.png title=Fast Reactors
Multiphysics model of a 7-pin SFR fuel bundle using NekRS-OpenMC-MOOSE [!cite](novak2022); figure shows fluid temperature predicted by a momentum source NekRS model with solid duct temperature predicted by BISON.

!card media/pts.png title=Pressurized Thermal Shock
Coupled NekRS [!ac](CFD) simulations with the MOOSE solid mechanics module for predicting stress-strain response in [!ac](LWR) reactor vessels [!cite](yu_2022). Figure shows the fluid velocity and temperature predicted by NekRS, which are then fed to a solid mechanics model.

!card media/sam_nek.png title=Systems Analysis
Coupled NekRS [!ac](CFD) simulations with systems-level feedback from SAM, for predicting tracer concentration in a loop with a double T-junction [!cite](huxford2023).
