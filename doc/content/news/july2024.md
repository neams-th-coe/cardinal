# July 2022 News

- A new [tally system](/actions/AddTallyAction.md) and an accompanying input syntax
  block have been added to Cardinal
- The tally parameters found in [OpenMCCellAverageProblem](/problems/OpenMCCellAverageProblem.md)
  have been deprecated in favor of this new tally system.

  - Existing input files written with the previous tally syntax will no longer run

The main advantages of the new tally system is the ability to add multiple tallies with different
spatial binning schemes for different scores. As an example, you can add a [CellTally](/tallies/CellTally.md)
with a heating score and a [MeshTally](/tallies/MeshTally.md) with a flux score:

!listing actions/multi_tally_example.i
  block=Tallies

Other advantages include:

- Being able to specify tally triggers on a per-tally basis;
- The option to apply block restrictions to different [CellTally](/tallies/CellTally.md)
  scores;
- Additional flexibility when it comes to adding new tally filters in the future.
