/**
 * Representation of a nekRS surface mesh as a native MooseMesh. This is
 * constructed by interpolating from the surface Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points
 * in nekRS to either a first-order (Quad4) or second-order (Quad9) mesh. This
 * mesh is only constructed for a user-specified set of boundaries in the nekRS
 * mesh with the 'boundary' parameter. Therefore, this class contains a mixture of
 * information related to the nekRS mesh (that nekRS solves its equations on)
 * versus the surface mesh constructed for data transfer with MOOSE (which is
 * only used by nekRS for the purpose of transferring its solution). All information
 * specific to the mesh nekRS actually uses for its solution are prefaced with either
 * '_nek' or 'nek' to help with this distinction.
 *
 * The nekRS mesh is currently implemented as a replicated mesh. On the nekRS side,
 * an Allgather is used to get the surface geometry information on each
 * nekRS process such that access from MOOSE can be performed on each process.
 *
 * TODO: The extension to higher than a second-order representation requires
 * some modifications to the formation of the mesh, as well as the interpolation
 * matrices used in NekRSProblem, because for 3rd order of higher, the equispaced
 * libMesh nodes no longer are a subset of the GLL ndoes.
