/**
 * Mapping of OpenMC to a collection of MOOSE elements, with temperature feedback
 * on solid cells and both temperature and density feedback on fluid cells. The
 * mapping is established automatically based on looping over all the MOOSE elements
 * and finding the OpenMC cell at each element's centroid.
 *
 * All feedback into OpenMC is performed via element averages, while all tallies
 * in OpenMC are averaged over cells. The 'fluid_blocks' parameter is used to
 * indicate which blocks in the MOOSE domain should be used to send density and
 * temperature to OpenMC, while the 'solid_blocks' parameter is used to indicate
 * which blocks in the MOOSE domain should be used to send temperature (and *not*
 * density) to OpenMC. Tallies are automatically added to the OpenMC cells that
 * correspond to the 'tally_blocks' parameter. Therefore, you can individually
 * control where multiphysics feedback is sent to OpenMC, and where heat source
 * feedback is received by MOOSE. If you have a single-level OpenMC geometry,
 * you can omit 'tally_blocks', in which case tallies are added to all MOOSE blocks.
 *
 * There are a number of limitations to this class (all of which are tested):
 *  - Each OpenMC cell shall only map to a single "phase", or else it is unclear
 *    whether that cell should receive temperature *and* density feedback, or
 *    only temperature feedback.
 *     TODO: If this is too restrictive in the future, we could implement some type
 *           of weighted averaging process. Also, if a cell maps to a phase and an
 *           unmapped region, perhaps we want to allow that.
 *  - Each OpenMC cell shall only map to a single tally type (on/off), or else
 *    it is unclear whether that cell should be tallied. For instance, if an OpenMC
 *    cell maps to elements that are in both fuel and cladding, and we've only added
 *    tallies to the fuel, we should error.
 *
 * Other limitations that are not tested (you won't error if you encounter these), are:
 *  - For the fluid, all the cells that we want to tally are on the same level in
 *    the OpenMC geometry. This level is specified with the 'fluid_cell_level' parameter.
 *    A similar restriction applies to the solid, with the 'solid_cell_level' parameter.
 *
 * Other considerations you should be aware of:
 *  - The density being transferred into OpenMC from MOOSE is in units of kg/m3; this
 *    is the unit employed by the MOOSE fluid properties module.
 *  - The temperature being transferred into OpenMC from MOOSE is in units of K; this
 *    is the unit employed by the MOOSE fluid properties module.
 *  - You will get some extra error checking at your disposal if your OpenMC geometry consists
 *    of a single coordinate level.

   * of centimeters (which might not even be possible depending on how material properties are
   * calculated for those other applications, like if thermal conductivity is computed by a

   * MOOSE application with an input written in terms of centimeters. Set this parameter to 100
   * if the coupled MOOSE application is in units of meters, for instance.

   * To summarize by example - if the MOOSE application uses units of meters, with a mesh

   * TRISO pebble - then not all of the power actually produced in the pebble is
   * tallies on the mesh approximation to that pebble. Therefore, if you set a core
   * power of 1 MW and you normalized based on a global kappa fission tally, you'd always
   * miss some of that power when sending to MOOSE. So, in this case, it is better to

   * - any situation where tallied, non-material-fill pebbles have different fills
   *   (such as if you have different TRISO lattices in each pebble)
   * - any situation where there is a "gap" in the incrementing of the material fill
