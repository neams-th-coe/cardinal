/**
 * Mapping of OpenMC to a collection of MOOSE elements, with temperature and/or
 * density feedback. The mappind is established authomatically by looping over
 * all the MOOSE elements and finding the OpenMC cell at each element's centroid.
 *
 * All feedback into OpenMC is performed via element averages. The
 * 'temperature_blocks' parameter is used to indicate which MOOSE blocks should
 * provide temperature feedback, while the 'density_blocks' parameter is used to
 * indicate which MOOSE blocks should provide density feedback. Tallies are
 * automatically added to OpenMC using either cell or mesh tallies.
 *
 * Each OpenMC cell shall not have ambiguous data transfers. That is, a cell
 * should map to a set of elements that are ALL/NONE providing temperature
 * feedback, ALL/NONE providing density feedback, ALL/NONE providing cell
 * tallies, and ALL/NONE being uncoupled altogether.
 *
 *  TODO: If this is too restrictive in the future, we could implement some type
 *        of weighted averaging process. Also, if a cell maps to a phase and an
 *        unmapped region, perhaps we want to allow that.
 *
 * Other considerations you should be aware of:
 *  - The density being transferred into OpenMC from MOOSE is in units of kg/m3; this
 *    is the unit employed by the MOOSE fluid properties module.
 *  - The temperature being transferred into OpenMC from MOOSE is in units of K; this
 *    is the unit employed by the MOOSE fluid and solid properties modules.
 *  - If your geometry is highly fine-scale (such as TRISOs), you might be able to get a
 *    huge speedup in your runtime if you (i) build your OpenMC model by repeating the same
 *    TRISO universe in each of your repeatable-units (e.g. pebbles, compacts, plates)
 *    AND (ii) leverage the 'identical_cell_fills' option.
