# Input of fluid flow of FLiBe in the outer reflector block fluid region.
# Material properties are taken for FLiBe at 650 C.

# The problem is run in nondimensional form with the following characteristic scales:
# L_ref  = 0.006    (the width of the smallest block-block gap)
# V_ref  = 0.0575   (velocity needed to get the specified Reynolds number)
# T_ref  = 923.15   (the inlet temperature)
# dT_ref = 10.0     (arbitrary temperature range value)
# t_ref  = 0.0208   (reference time scale)
# rho_0  = 1962.13
# mu_0   = 6.77e-3
# Cp_0   = 2416
# k_0    = 1.09
# Pr     = 15.005
